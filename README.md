# Anti Invisible Hacker

This bakkesmod plugin counters the invisible hack by spawning the hacker's car as it should usually do.
All you have to do is check **EnablePlugin**, and everytime you'll encounter a hacker, it will execute the patch automatically.

You can enable/disable the plugin. **Enable Canvas** is just in case the patch doesn't work, it will render a cube where the hacker's car is.
The button **Reveal Invisible Hackers** is for calling the patch manually
